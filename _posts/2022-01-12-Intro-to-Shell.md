### Why Shell?

Both the *Shell* and a *graphical file explorer* allow you to interact with your OS through commands. If mastered, the Shell is more efficient because it does not require you to navigate on a graphical interface.

### Usefull commands

#### What is my current working directory?
> pwd

#### What files do I have in my directory?
> ls

#### How can I indicate a relative path?
> /

#### How can I change the directory I am on?
> cd

##### The current directory
>> .

##### The parent directory
>> ..

##### The home directory
>> ~
