### Why Shell?

Both the *Shell* and a *graphical file explorer* allow you to interact with your OS through commands. If mastered, the Shell is more efficient because it does not require you to navigate on a graphical interface.

### Usefull commands

#### What is my current working directory?

> pwd

#### What files do I have in my directory?

> ls

#### Indicate a relative path

> /

#### Change the directory

> cd

##### current directory

>> .

##### parent directory

>> ..

##### home directory

>> ~
