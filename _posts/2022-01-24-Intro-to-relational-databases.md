## Prerequisites

- For Setup on a Mac see [here](https://medium.com/@xueyingli66/start-using-postgresql-with-terminal-on-mac-787ab643c817), [here](https://medium.com/@viviennediegoencarnacion/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-mac-e6a5f48ee399) and [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/postgresql-basics-to-get-you-up-and-running-macos-f0a14d51aed0)


If you are a Mac user, you can install Postgresql via Homebrew. Open your Terminal and check whether Homebrew is already installed.

```Terminal
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```
